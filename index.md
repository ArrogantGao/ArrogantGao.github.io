# Greetings!

I am Xuanzhao Gao, a PhD student in Hongkong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).

This is my personal website, hope you enjoy!

# About Me

I am a PhD student at Hongkong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). My research interests include computational physics, application mathematics, and high-performance computing. I am currently working on the development of fast algorithms for kernel summation problems and tensor network contraction problems.

1. [How to implement generic matrix multiplication (GEMM) with generic element types on GPU?](/CuTropicalGEMM/)

    This blog is a technical note for the [Open Source Promotion Plan 2023](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) project ["TropicalGEMM on GPU"](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/prodetail/23fec0105?lang=en&list=pro) released by JuliaCN, where I developed a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package [CuTropicalGemm.jl](https://github.com/TensorBFS/CuTropicalGEMM.jl) calculate Generic Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) of Tropical Numbers on Nvidia GPUs.

# Open Source Packages

* [CuTropicalGEMM.jl](https://github.com/TensorBFS/CuTropicalGEMM.jl)
  * A Julia package to speed up the generic matrix multiplication of Tropical Numbers using GPU.
* [ExTinyMD.jl](https://github.com/HPMolSim/ExTinyMD.jl)
  * A simple but fast molecular dynamic framework in Julia.
* [ChebParticleMesh.jl](https://github.com/HPMolSim/ChebParticleMesh.jl)
  * A Julia package to calculate the electrostatic potential of charged systems using Chebyshev interpolation (very similar to NUFFT).
